## Features

- **High Performance**: Built with Bun, this gateway ensures blazing fast request handling.
- **Configurable**: Easily set up routing based on paths or prefixes.
- **Lightweight**: Perfect for local development and small setups.
- **Microservice Friendly**: Seamlessly integrates with various microservices.

## Getting Started

To get started with Bun Microservice Gateways, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ratul3429/bun-microservice-gateways.git
   cd bun-microservice-gateways
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Bun installed. If you haven't installed Bun yet, follow the instructions on the [official Bun website](https://bun.sh/).

   Once Bun is installed, run:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the Gateway**:
   Start the gateway using:
   ```bash
   bun start
   ```

## Configuration

You can configure the gateway using a simple JSON file. Create a file named `config.json` in the root directory of your project. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "path": "/service1",
      "target": "http://localhost:3001"
    },
    {
      "path": "/service2",
      "target": "http://localhost:3002"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation

- **path**: The URL path that the gateway will listen to.
- **target**: The URL of the internal microservice that will handle the request.

## Usage

Once you have configured your routes, you can start sending requests to your gateway. Here are some examples:

- To send a request to Service 1:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/service1
  ```

- To send a request to Service 2:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/service2
  ```

The gateway will forward these requests to the respective internal services based on the paths defined in your configuration.
